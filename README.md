This repo contains Ansible's most popular modules that are shipped with Ansible.

New module submissions for modules that do not yet exist should be submitted to ansible-modules-extras, rather than this repo.

Take care to submit tickets to the appropriate repo where modules are contained.  The docs.ansible.com website indicates this at the bottom of each module documentation page.
